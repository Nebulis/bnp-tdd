- Break dependencies.
- Add a new functionality using TDD.


### 2. Steps

- Assumption : Code is known well enough to add tests.
- With the provided code, follow these steps :
  - Break dependency with the `System` class.
  - Add tests.
  - Check all tests pass.
  - Refactor using SOLID principles (especially SRP).
